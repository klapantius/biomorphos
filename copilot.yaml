# GitHub Copilot configuration for the biomorphos project

project:
  name: biomorphos - A Life Cycle Simulation Game
  description: >
    The project "biomorphos - A Life Cycle Simulation Game" models the development of simple cell cultures.
    The game runs through iterations where the cells evolve by interaction.
    The states, properties/types of the cells, the rules, and other factors – such as the environment
    influencing the cells externally – are hihgly configurable.
    The project starts with a very simple prototype.
    Then it starts to implement a core library with relative simple rules and interactions. In a later phase, it will be extended with more complex rules and interactions.
    phase cells may be able to evolve and adapt to keep living. Different cells types in the same
    environment are also imaginable.
    In parallel to the core library, user interfaces will be developed for different platforms.
  requirements:
    - All code must be compatible with .NET 6.0 or later.
    - Use C# best practices and .NET naming conventions.
    - Prefer clear, readable code over clever or overly compact code.
    - Add XML documentation comments to all public methods and classes.
    - Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line statements.
      It is okay to write single-line if/for/etc statements, but the bodies  must be
      enclosed in curly braces.
    - Write unit tests for all new methods.
    - Do not use external dependencies unless explicitly allowed.
    - Output files should be written to the output folder under the project root unless otherwise specified.

subprojects:
  - name: library
    purpose: >
      Type definitions, core logic and calculations.
    rules of the game:
      - The game simulates cells like factories that transform inputs into outputs.
      - The game is played on a grid of cells over multiple iterations.
      - Every iteration consists of two phases:
        1. Collecting requests and sharing outputs.
        2. Consuming inputs and producing outputs.
      - In opposite to the prototype, in this game there are no cell-states, but life-power.
    types:
      - Grid: A logical layer combining the storage of cells and the calculation of relationships.
          Both services will be delegated to specialized implementations.
          The grid provides relation information about each cells of it. A grid has an own topology which
          will be applied to the coordinates calculated for a cell as related cells.
      - CellStorage: A storage for cells that can be queried by their coordinates.
          It should provide methods to get, set, and remove cells. There are multiple implementations
          of this interface depending on the topology and the requirements of the grid.
      - Coordinates:
          Coordinates are a generic interface to represent positions in the grid.
          This allows for different coordinate systems to be used in different topologies.
      - DimensionProvider: A service that provides the dimensions of the grid.
          It is aimed to ensure dimensional consistency across the grid and its coordinates-based plugins.
      - GridTopology: Describes properties of the whole grid as such, like boundaries (if any), size,
         and dimensions. It can normalize coordinates so that they fit to the grid.
      - RelationshipTopology: Describes the relations between cells.
          A simple topology is for example a square grid or a 3D cubic grid.
          A little more advanced topology could specify a square grid with wrap-around edges (cylinder or torus).
          The grid should be able to provide the neighbors of a cell for calculations.
      - Cell: A cell is a factory which turns inputs into outputs. These can be considered as materials.
          The cell itself needs a certain amount of it's input for its life-power. The rest will be used to produce outputs.
          All input materials must be available for the production to take place. The production will use the maximal amount
          of materials according to a given proportion of them. The rest of materials after the production will be added
          back to the cell's storage.
          In each round, the cell first collects the requests from the connected cells and shares its outputs according to a given proportion.
          Then it calls off the required amount of materials from the connected cells. After all connected cells delivered what they could,
          the cell will produce outputs for the next iteration.
    rules:
      - Define separate classes for Grid, Cell, and Simulation logic.
      - Use interfaces where appropriate to allow for future extension.
      - Prepare the codebase for additional cell states and rules.
      - Add basic unit tests for core classes.
      - Maintain compatibility with the requirements of the main project.
  - name: apps
    purpose: >
      All kinds of user interfaces, including web, desktop, and mobile applications.
  - name: tests
    purpose: >
      Unit tests for the core library and applications.
    rules:
      - Use NUnit for unit testing.
      - Each test should be independent and not rely on the state of other tests.
      - Mock external dependencies where necessary to isolate tests.
      - Ensure high code coverage for all core logic.
  - name: prototype
    purpose: >
      A minimal prototype demonstrating the core simulation logic for a cell culture automation.
      Implements a simple grid, cell state transitions, and HTML visualization of each iteration.
    rules:
      - The simulation grid must be square and configurable in size.
      - Cell states: NonExistent, WillBeBorn, Alive, WillDie.
      - The simulation must be reproducible given the same initial state.
      - Generated HTML must visualize each iteration of the simulation.
      - Only the four direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) are considered for state changes.
      - No user interaction or external input is required.
